ocean_data_tools simplifies the process of extracting, formatting, and visualizing freely-available oceanographic data. While a wealth of oceanographic data is accessible online, some end-users may be dissuaded from utilizing this data due to the overhead associated with obtaining and formatting it into usable data structures. ocean_data_tools solves this problem by allowing the user to transform common oceanographic data sources into uniform structs, call generalized functions on these structs, easily perform custom calculations, and make graphics.

### [Getting Started](#getting-started-1)

### [Dependencies](#dependencies-1)

### [Accessing Help](#accessing-help-1)

### [How to Contribute](#how-to-contribute-1)

### [Contents](#contents-1)

### [Finding Data](#finding-data-1)

### [Citing ODT](#citing-odt-1)

## Getting Started

1. Download [bathymetry](#bathymetry).
2. Download [nctoolbox](https://github.com/nctoolbox/nctoolbox). You will need to run the command ``setup_nctoolbox`` at the beginning of each MATLAB session.
3. Add ocean_data_tools and nctoolbox to the path. Specifically, the following folders must be added to the [path](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/what-is-the-matlab-search-path.html):

- ocean_data_tools/ocean_data_tools
- ocean_data_tools/ocean_data_tools/utilities
- nctoolbox/

4. Run each demonstration in **demos/demos.m**, which contains example usages for all functions. All required test data is included in **data/**.

Functions are named using a two-part system. The prefix (``argo_``, ``bathymetry_``, ``general_``, etc.) indicates the appropriate data source, while the suffix (``\_build``, ``\_profiles``, ``\_section``, etc.) indicates the action performed. Functions with the ``\_build`` suffix load raw data into uniform structs (e.g. ``argo``, ``cruise``, ``hycom``, ``mercator``, ``woa``, ``wod``). Uniform structs created by ``\_build`` functions are compatable with any ``general_`` function.

Main functions are located in **ocean_data_tools/**. Demonstrations are located in **demos/**. Test datas are located in **data/**. Shell scripts for batch downloading data are located in **shell_scripts/**. While shell scripts can be run directly in a macOS Terminal, running them in Windows requires [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) (and perhaps slight modification of commands). Python syntax examples are located in **python/**, which may be grow to become a module in the future.

## Dependencies

The only true dependency is [nctoolbox](https://github.com/nctoolbox/nctoolbox).

It is recommended to also download [Gibbs-SeaWater (GSW) Oceanographic Toolbox](http://www.teos-10.org/software.htm#1). A benefit of ocean_data_tools is that neatly packs data into uniform structs; at which point a user can easily apply custom calculations or functions from other toolboxes such as GSW. See an [example](docs/gsw_example.md).

## Accessing Help

To access help, run the command ``doc ocean_data_tools``.

## How to Contribute

* Want to make changes or add a new function? (1) Fork the repository (make your own separate copy), (2) make changes, and (3) open a 'pull request'. Once approved, it can be merged into the master branch. If you wish to chat beforehand about your contribution, open an issue or email lnferris@alum.mit.edu. 
* Don't use git often and don't want to remember all the terminal commands? Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
* Find a bug in the code? Open an 'issue' to notify contributors and create an official record.

Before contributing, please see [Contents](#contents-1) and consider how your function fits into ocean_data_tools and its ethos of structure arrays. At a minimum, functions must be well-documented and address a specific freely-available oceanographic data source which can be accessed by anyone online.

Adding a new function isn't the only way to help ocean_data_tools bring data to the people. Python, Julia, etc. translations of existing Matlab functions are also welcomed!

If you are interested in becoming a formal collaborator (e.g. have direct access and co-manage this repository), please reach out.

## Finding Data

There two types of datasets: those that need to be downloaded manually<sup>1</sup> and those that can be accessed remotely<sup>2</sup> through OpenDAP (e.g. the data can be accessed directly on the the internet using a url). 

#### argo<sup>1</sup>

Download [Argo data](https://argo.ucsd.edu/) directly from GDAC FTP servers using either the [Coriolis selection tool](http://www.argodatamgt.org/Access-to-data/Argo-data-selection), or the [US GDAC](https://nrlgodae1.nrlmry.navy.mil/cgi-bin/argo_select.pl). See the [Argo User's Manual](http://www.argodatamgt.org/Documentation) for more information.

Alternatively run **shell_scripts/download_argo** to download data via File Transfer Protocol.

#### bathymetry<sup>1</sup>

To get bathymetry data (for ``bathymetry_dir``), download Smith & Sandwell under [Global Topography V19.1](https://topex.ucsd.edu/marine_topo/) in netcdf form (topo_20.1.nc).

#### glider<sup>1</sup>

Vist [gliders.ioos.us/erddap](https://gliders.ioos.us/erddap/index.html). Click "View a List of All 779 Datasets" or use the "Advanced Search". After choosing a dataset, navigate to the [Data Access Form](https://gliders.ioos.us/erddap/tabledap/ce_311-20170725T1930-delayed.html). To get started, select these variables:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24570061/94058620-419af580-fdaf-11ea-859a-616c8b5b1433.png" width="700">

Scroll to "File type:". In the drop-down menu, select ".nc". Click "Submit".

#### mocha<sup>2</sup>

The url for MOCHA Mid-Atlantic Bight climatology is embedded. See [Rutgers Marine catalog](http://tds.marine.rutgers.edu/thredds/catalog.html).

#### model<sup>1,2</sup>

HYCOM data may be accessed remotely using OpenDAP. Get the data url by visiting the [HYCOM website](https://www.hycom.org/dataserver/gofs-3pt1/analysis). For example, click Access Data Here -> GLBv0.08/expt_57.7 (Jun-01-2017 to Sep-30-2017)/ -> Hindcast Data: Jun-01-2017 to Sep-30-2017. Click on the OpenDAP link. Copy the url as and use this as the ``source`` in ``model_build_profiles``.

Alteratively, download subsetted HYCOM data using NCSS. Get the data url by visiting the [HYCOM website](https://www.hycom.org/dataserver/gofs-3pt1/analysis). For example, click Access Data Here -> GLBv0.08/expt_57.7 (Jun-01-2017 to Sep-30-2017)/ -> Hindcast Data: Jun-01-2017 to Sep-30-2017. Click on the NetcdfSubset link. Set constraints and copy the NCSS Request URL at the bottom of the page. Run **shell_scripts/download_hycom_lite**. To download multiple months or years, run **shell_scripts/download_hycom_bulk_daily** (partition files by day) or **shell_scripts/download_hycom_bulk_monthly** (partition files by month). Please use responsibly.

For Mercator, download Copernicus Marine data directly from FTP servers. First make a [Copernicus account](http://marine.copernicus.eu/services-portfolio/access-to-products/). Use the selection tool to download GLOBAL_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_PHY_001_024. Alternatively run **shell_scripts/download_mercator**. Before running the script, follow the instructions for modifying your ~/.netrc file in the comments of the script.

#### whp_cruise<sup>1</sup>

For [GO-SHIP data](https://usgoship.ucsd.edu/hydromap/), get CTD data (for ``ctdo_dir``) by choosing a [GO-SHIP cruise](https://cchdo.ucsd.edu/search?q=GO-SHIP) and downloading the CTD data in whp_netcdf format. More information about whp_netcdf parameters is available [here](https://exchange-format.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#). Get LADCP data (for ``uv_dir``, ``wke_dir``) [here](https://currents.soest.hawaii.edu/go-ship/ladcp/). There is information about LACDP processing [here](https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~ant/LADCP.html).

#### woa<sup>2</sup>

Functions build the World Ocean Atlas url at maximum resolution based on arguments, but coarser resolutions and seasonal climatologies are available at the [NODC website](https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/woa18/woa18data.html). Note NCEI is scheduled to update data urls in the near future. Functions will be updated as such.

#### wod<sup>1</sup>

Search the [World Ocean Database](https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/SELECT/dbsearch/dbsearch.html) and select products.
