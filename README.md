# ocean_data_tools
Tools for searching, subsetting, and analyzing ocean data.

# ocean_data_tools/ArgoTools.py 
Download Argo data (www.argo.ucsd.edu) using either the Coriolis selection tool (http://www.argodatamgt.org/Access-to-data/Argo-data-selection) or the US GDAC (http://www.usgodae.org/cgi-bin/argo_select.pl). Run this Python script to search your data for profiles in a specific region and date range. Make a map of profile locations. Plot vertical profiles.

# ocean_data_tools/ArgoTools.m
Same as above, but for MATLAB users.

# ocean_data_tools/GOSHIPTools.py
Choose a GO-SHIP cruise (https://cchdo.ucsd.edu/search?q=GO-SHIP) and download the **CTD** data in **whp_netcdf** format. Run this Python script to load the data into a dataframe, subset the data by date/region, map the station locations, or plot vertical profiles.

# ocean_data_tools/inspect_GOSHIP.py
Run this script on one of your downloaded GO-SHIP data files to learn which variables are in the file. Visit (https://exchange-format.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#) for information about whp_netcdf parameters.

# ocean_data_tools/HYCOMTools2D.m
This script requires an internet connection. Get the data url by visiting https://www.hycom.org/dataserver/gofs-3pt1/analysis. Click Access Data Here -> GLBv0.08/expt_57.7 (Jun-01-2017 to Sep-30-2017)/ -> Hindcast Data: Jun-01-2017 to Sep-30-2017. Copy the OPENDAP url. Makes 2-D plots of temperature, salinity, velcoity, sea surface elevation.
